// Migration script to help understand the changes made for image persistence

/**
 * BEFORE (Local Storage - NOT Persistent):
 * 
 * 1. Images stored in ./upload/images/
 * 2. Multer saves files to local disk
 * 3. Static route serves images from local directory
 * 4. Images lost on container restart (Render/Heroku/etc.)
 * 
 * Problems:
 * - Ephemeral storage on cloud platforms
 * - Images disappear after redeploy
 * - Not scalable for multiple server instances
 */

/**
 * AFTER (Cloudinary - Persistent):
 * 
 * 1. Images stored in Cloudinary cloud
 * 2. Multer uploads directly to Cloudinary
 * 3. No local storage needed
 * 4. Images persist permanently
 * 
 * Benefits:
 * - Permanent storage
 * - Global CDN delivery
 * - Automatic optimization
 * - Scalable across multiple servers
 */

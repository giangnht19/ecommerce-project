# Final Deployment Steps

## Issue: Stripe Payment Redirects to Localhost

The payment system is redirecting to localhost instead of your Vercel deployment because the CLIENT_URL environment variable needs to be set on Render.

## Solution Steps:

### 1. Update Environment Variable on Render

1. Go to your Render dashboard: https://render.com/
2. Find your ecommerce server service
3. Go to Environment section
4. Add this environment variable:
   - **Key:** `CLIENT_URL`
   - **Value:** `https://fashfrenzy-49ydbnogf-edward-nguyens-projects-bdf174b5.vercel.app`

### 2. Redeploy Server
After adding the environment variable, Render will automatically redeploy your server.

### 3. Test Payment Flow
1. Go to your client: https://fashfrenzy-49ydbnogf-edward-nguyens-projects-bdf174b5.vercel.app
2. Add items to cart
3. Proceed to checkout
4. Complete Stripe payment
5. Verify it redirects back to your Vercel app instead of localhost

## Current Deployment URLs:
- **Client:** https://fashfrenzy-49ydbnogf-edward-nguyens-projects-bdf174b5.vercel.app
- **Admin:** https://shop-admin-page-1cmnx2w3a-edward-nguyens-projects-bdf174b5.vercel.app  
- **Server:** https://ecommerce-project-9xmw.onrender.com

## Code Changes Made:
âœ… Updated orderController.js to use dynamic CLIENT_URL
âœ… Added fallback to localhost for development
âœ… All image URLs working correctly
âœ… Both client and admin deployed successfully

## Next Steps:
1. Update Render environment variable (manual step)
2. Test payment flow
3. Deployment complete! ðŸŽ‰
